    <string name="big_text"> 2 Add the wet ingredients to the dry,
        along with the carrots, raisins and half the nuts, if using.
        Mix well to combine, then divide between the tins.
        Bake for 25-30 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre
        of the cake comes out clean. If any wet mixture clings to the skewer,
        return to the oven for 5 mins, then check again. Leave to cool in the tins.
         3 To make the icing, beat the butter and sugar together
        until smooth. Add half the cream cheese and beat again, then add the rest
        (adding it bit by bit prevents the icing from splitting). Remove the cakes
        from the tins and sandwich together with half the icing.
        Top with the remaining icing and scatter with the remaining walnuts.
        Will keep in the fridge for up to five days. Best eaten at room temperature.
